    ISFP: The Artist (Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving) 

    ISFP is a four-letter code representing one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.
    People with an ISFP personality are frequently described as quiet, easy-going and peaceful. 

    According to David Keirsey, the creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 5 to 10 percent of people have 
    an ISFP personality type. ISFP is the opposite of ENTJ. 

    Key ISFP Characteristics

    ISFPs like to keep their options open, so they often delay making decisions in order to see if things might change or if new options come up.
    According to Myers-Briggs, ISFPs are kind, friendly, sensitive and quiet. Unlike extroverts who gain energy from interacting with other people, introverts must expend energy around others.2﻿ After spending time with people, introverts often find that they need a period of time alone. Because of this, they typically prefer to intermingle with a small group of close friends and family members.
    While they are quiet and reserved, they are also known for being peaceful, caring, and considerate. ISFPs have an easy-going attitude and tend to accept other people as they are.
    ISFPs like to focus on the details. They spend more time thinking about the here and now rather than worrying about the future.
    ISFPs tend to be "doers" rather than "dreamers." They dislike abstract theories unless they can see some type of practical application for them and prefer learning situations that involve gaining hands-on experience.

Cognitive Functions

The MBTI identifies four key cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensing) that are either directed outwardly (extraverted) or inwardly (introverted).3﻿ The hierarchical order to these functions is what determines each individual's unique personality.
Dominant: Introverted Feeling

    ISFPs care more about personal concerns rather than objective, logical information.
    People with this personality type deal with information and experiences based upon how they feel about them.
    ISFPs have their own value system and create spontaneous judgments based upon how things fit with their own idea.

Auxiliary: Extraverted Sensing

    People with ISFP personalities are very in tune with the world around them. They are very much attuned to sensory information and are keenly aware when even small changes take place in their immediate environment. Because of this, they often place a high emphasis on aesthetics and appreciate the fine arts.
    They are focused on the present moment, taking in new information and then taking action. They have a strong sense of their immediate surroundings, often noticing small details that others might overlook. When remembering events from the past, they are able to recall strong visual imagery and sights, smells, and sounds can evoke powerful memories associated with those senses.

Tertiary: Introverted Intuition

    This function tends to run in the background, feeding off of the extraverted sensing function.
    As ISFPs take in details about the world, they often develop "gut feelings" about events and situations. While they generally do not like abstract concepts or ideas, this introverted intuition function may lead them to experience epiphanies about themselves and others.

    Inferior: Extraverted Thinking

    One weakness that ISFPs may have is in organizing, although they may use this function more prominently in certain situations.
    This function is all about looking for the most efficient way to do something. An ISFP might become focused on being very precise about the details and finding the most effective way to express an idea.

Personal Relationships

ISFPs are introverted. They tend to be reserved and quiet, especially around people they do not know well. They prefer spending time with a close group of family and friends.

ISFPs are very private and keep their true feelings to themselves. In some cases, they may avoid sharing their thoughts, feelings and opinions with other people in their life, even their romantic partners. Because they prefer not to share their innermost feelings and try to avoid conflict, they often defer to the needs or demands of others.

ISFPs have strong values but are not concerned with trying to convince other people to share their point of view. They care deeply about other people, particularly their closest friends and family. They are action-oriented and tend to show their care and concern through action rather than discussing feelings or expressing sentiments.
Career Paths

People with ISFP personalities love animals and have a strong appreciation for nature. They may seek out jobs or hobbies that put them in contact with the outdoors and with animals.

Because ISFPs prefer to focus on the present, they often do well in careers that are concerned with practical, real-world problems. Jobs that offer a great deal of personal freedom and autonomy are especially appealing to ISFPs.

    Tips for Interacting With ISFPs
    Friendships
    
        ISFPs are friendly and get along well with other people, but they typically need to get to know you well before they really open up.
        You can be a good friend to an ISFP by being supporting an accepting of who they are.
        ISFPs can be light-hearted and fun, but they are also quite intense at times. Recognize that there will be times when your friend wants to share and times when he or she will want to retreat to a more personal space.
    
    Parenting
    
        ISFP children tend to be perfectionists and can be their own harshest critics.
        Because they place such high expectations on themselves, they often underestimate or undervalue their own skills and talents.
        If you are a parent to ISFP child, you can help your child by encouraging them to be kind to themselves and recognize their value.
    
    Relationships
    
        ISFPs are very considerate in relationships, often to the point that they will continually defer to their partner.
        Because they are usually not good at expressing their own feelings and needs, it is important that you make an effort to understand your partner.
        When making decisions, ensure that your partner's voice is heard and his or her feelings are given equal weight.
