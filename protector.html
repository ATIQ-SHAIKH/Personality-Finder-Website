    ISFJ: The Protector (Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging) 

    ISFJ is one of the 16 personality types identified on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), 
    the personality test developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs based on the theories
     of psychoanalyst Carl Jung. ISFJ stands for introverted, sensing, feeling, judging.

    This personality type is given the nickname "The Protector" or "The Defender," and for good reason.
     People who have ISFJ personalities are known for being warm-hearted, responsible, and reserved. The 
     ENTP personality type is the opposite. 

     This personality type is one of the more common ones. They make up about 9% to 14% of the population. 

     Key ISFJ Characteristics

     Below are the main characteristics of this personality type.
     They Are Observant
     
     While people with this personality type are introverted and tend to be quiet, they are keen observers
    and are focused on other people. Because they are so perceptive, ISFJs are good at remembering details about other people. 

    They Tend to Repress Their Emotions

    Those with this personality type are particularly well-tuned into the emotions and feelings of others. While ISFJs are good at understanding their own emotions, they often struggle to express them. Rather than share their feelings, they may bottle them up, sometimes to the point that negative feelings toward other people can result.
    
    When dealing with life struggles, such as illness or the death of a loved one, they may keep quiet about what they are experiencing to avoid burdening others with their troubles.
    They Are Practical
    
    People with this personality prefer concrete facts over abstract theories. As a result, they tend to learn best by doing. They thrive in This also means that they usually value learning for its practical applications. They also tend to become more interested in new things when they can see and appreciate how it might solve a real-world problem.
    They Are Creatures of Habit
    
    ISFJs enjoy structure and strive to maintain this order in all areas of their lives. They thrive in highly structured and consistent environments where they are given step-by-step instructions and clear expectations.
    
    Their preference to keep things the way they are rather than change. But this does not mean ISFJs aren't adaptable. They simply prefer to have time to think about and prepare for big changes.

        Cognitive Functions

        The MBTI was created by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs in the 1940s based on the theories of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Jung believed that several mental processes made up each individual's psychological type. He identified four key psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. Each of these functions then tends to be either outwardly focused (extraverted) or inwardly focused (introverted).
        
        MBTI advocates often utilize what they refer to as a functional stack when analyzing results. You can think of the different cognitive functions as the ingredients that go into making up a personality type. The specific recipe for each type is controlled by how these different ingredients combine and interact. The MBTI itself relies on two key factors that combine in different ways to give us the 16 different types. First is the functions themselves, and second is the hierarchical order of those functions.
        
        Each type possesses a dominant function that is the core characteristic of each type. This is then supported by an auxiliary function which is another well-developed aspect of personality. The tertiary and inferior functions are less conscious and not as well-formed.
        
        INFJs tend to rely more on four primary cognitive functions:
        Dominant: Introverted Intuition
        
            This means that they tend to be highly focused on their internal insights.
            Once they have formed an intuition about something, they tend to stick to it very tightly, often to the point of being single-minded in their focus.
            Because of this, they are sometimes viewed as being stubborn and unyielding.
        
        Auxiliary: Extraverted Feeling
        
            This characteristic of this type makes INFJs highly aware of what other people are feeling, but it means they are sometimes less aware of their own emotions.
            INFJs sometimes struggle to say no to other people's requests for this reason. They are so attuned to what other people are feeling that they fear causing disappointment or hurt feelings.
        
        Tertiary: Introverted Thinking
        
            INFJs make decisions based on ideas and theories that they form based on their own insights.
            INFJs rely primarily on their introverted intuition and extroverted feeling when making decisions, particularly when they are around other people. When they are alone, however, people with this personality type may rely more on their introverted thinking.
            In stressful situations, an INFJ might try to rely on emotions when making decisions, especially if it means pleasing other people. Under less stressful conditions, however, an INFJ is more likely to rely more on their intuition.
        
        Inferior: Extraverted Sensing
        
            While this is a less developed and largely unconscious aspect of the INFJ, it does have an impact on personality.
            This aspect of personality helps INFJs pay attention to the world around them and stay aware of their surroundings.
            Extroverted sensing also helps INFJs better live in the present moment, rather than simply worrying about the future.
            This aspect of personality also helps INFJs appreciate physical activities such as hiking and dancing.

        Tips for Interacting With INFJs
        Friendships
        
        Because they are reserved and private, INFJs can be difficult to get to know. They place a high value on close, deep 
        relationships and can be hurt easily, although they often hide these feelings from others. Interacting with an INFJ 
        involves understanding and supporting their need to retreat and recharge. People with this personality type sometimes 
        feel misunderstood. You can be a good friend by taking the time to understand their perspective and appreciating their strengths.
        Parenting
        
        Because INFJs are so skilled at understanding feelings, they tend to be very close and connected to their children. 
        They have high standards and can have very high behavioral expectations. They are concerned with raising children that 
        are kind, caring, and compassionate. INFJs encourage their children to pursue their interests and talents to fully realize 
        their individual potential.
        Relationships
        
        INFJs have an innate ability to understand other people's feelings and enjoy being in close, intimate relationships. 
        They tend to flourish best in romantic relationships with people with who they share their core values. As a partner, 
        it is important to provide the support and emotional intimacy that an INFJ craves. Sincerity, honesty, and authenticity 
        are all traits that the INFJ appreciates in their partner.
