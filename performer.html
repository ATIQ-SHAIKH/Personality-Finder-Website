        ESFP (extraverted, sensing, feeling, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.1 People with ESFP personality types are often described as spontaneous, resourceful, and outgoing. They love being the center of attention and are often described as entertainers or “class clowns.” ESFP is the opposite of the INTJ personality type.


ESFP Personality Type
Illustration by JR Bee, Verywell
According to psychologist David Keirsey, the developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 4% to 10% of all people have an ESFP personality type.

Key ESFP Characteristics
ESFPs tend to be very practical and resourceful. They prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend to dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types sometimes struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to interact with others or learn through direct experience.
ESFPs live very much in the here-and-now and sometimes fail to think about how current actions will lead to long-term consequences. They will often rush into a new situation and figure things out as they happen. They also tend to dislike routine, enjoy new experiences, and are always looking for a new adventure.
In addition to having a strong awareness of their surroundings, they are also very understanding and perceptive when it comes to other people. They are able to sense what others are feeling and know how to respond. People tend to find them warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.
While ESFPs are fun-loving and do not shun the spotlight, they are more interested in simply living in the present and doing what feels right at that moment.

Cognitive Functions
The MBTI suggests that individual personalities are marked by many different cognitive functions (sensing, thinking, feeling, and intuition). Some of these are more dominant than others and the hierarchical order of these functions influences how people perceive and relate to the world.


These functions are focused outwardly (extraverted) and in other cases, they are focused inwardly (introverted). Extraverted functions are focused on interacting and acting within the world around you, while introverted functions are centered on internal reflection and analysis.


Dominant: Extraverted Sensing
ESFPs prefer to focus on the here-and-now rather than thinking about the distant future. They also prefer learning about concrete facts rather than theoretical ideas.
ESFPs don’t spend a lot of time planning and organizing. Instead, they like to keep their options open.
When solving problems, they trust their instincts and put trust in their own abilities to come up with a solution. While they are reasonable and pragmatic, they dislike structure, order, and planning. Instead, they act spontaneously and do not spend a great deal of time coming up with a plan or schedule.

Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling
ESFPs place a greater emphasis on personal feelings rather than logic and facts when making decisions.
People with this personality type have an internal system of values on which they base their decisions. They are very much aware of their own emotions and are empathetic towards others. They excel at putting themselves in another person's shoes, so to speak.
Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking
This function is focused on enforcing order on the outside world. It is centered on productivity, logic, and results.
Because this tends to be a weaker aspect of personality, ESFPs may not always feel secure sharing their judgments, especially if they feel it will disrupt the harmony of the group.
Inferior: Introverted Intuition
While this is the least prominent aspect of personality, this function can help the ESFP spot patterns and make connections in things they have observed.
ESFPs are usually not particularly adept at using logic to sort through abstract concepts, but this sense can sometimes lead to flashes of insight and epiphanies about themselves or the world.
