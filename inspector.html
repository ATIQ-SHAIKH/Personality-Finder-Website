    ISTJ: The Inspector (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) 

    ISTJ (introversion, sensing, thinking, judgment) is a four-letter code representing one of the 16 personality 
    types found on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). People with an ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved, 
    practical and quiet. They enjoy order and organization in all areas of their lives including their home, work, family, 
    and projects. ISTJs value loyalty in themselves and others, and place an emphasis on traditions. 

    Key ISTJ Characteristics

    ISTJs are planners; they like to carefully plan things out well in advance. They enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When things are in disarray, people with this personality type may find themselves unable to rest until they have set everything straight and the work has been completed.
    ISTJs are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical approach to achieving goals and completing projects and are able to work at a steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They are able to ignore distractions in order to focus on the task at hand and are often described as dependable and trustworthy.
    ISTJs also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws. They prefer to follow rules and procedures that have previously been established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and unyielding in their desire to maintain structure.

    Cognitive Functions

    The MBTI suggests that the four different cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensing) form a hierarchy. Each function is either directed outwardly (extraverted) or inwardly (introverted) and the order of these functions determines an individual's personality.1
    Dominant: Introverted Sensing
    
        Introverted sensors are focused on the present moment, taking in an abundance of information about their surroundings.
        They also have vivid memories of the past and rely on the memories of these experiences to form expectations for the future.
    
    Auxiliary: Extraverted Thinking
    
        ISTJs are logical and efficient. They enjoy looking for rational explanations for events.
        They prefer to focus on the details rather than thinking about abstract information.
        Being efficient and productive is important for people with this personality type. They appreciate knowledge that has immediate, practical applications.
        ISTJs make decisions based on logic and objective data rather than personal feelings.
    
    Tertiary: Introverted Feeling
    
        As they make judgments, ISTJs often make personal interpretations based on their internal set of values.
        This is often described as an "instinct" or "gut feeling" about a situation. ISTJ might make a decision based on logic, only to have this feeling kick in telling them to trust their feelings rather than just the facts.
    
    Inferior: Extraverted Intuition
    
        This aspect of personality enjoys new ideas and experiences.
        This is the weakest part of the ISTJs personality, but developing this function can sometimes lead to a more balanced personality.

Tips for Interacting With ISTJs

Friendships

ISTJs tend to get along best with friends who are similar to themselves. 
While they tend to be a bit serious and by the book, they do like to have fun. 
They might not be willing to jump into new things, but you can be a great friend
by helping them pursue hobbies and activities that they enjoy.

Parenting

ISTJ parents tend to be quite focused on tradition and are good at providing security 
and stability to their children. Children of ISTJ parents often find that their parents 
will treat them with care and respect and that they also expect the same treatment in return.

Parents of ISTJ children will find that providing consistency can help their children feel more 
secure. Sticking to routines, introducing change slowly, and giving them time to adjust to new 
situations are all ways to help an ISTJ child.
Relationships

While ISTJs may experience deep feelings, they often struggle to show that side of themselves 
in romantic relationships. You can be an understanding partner by not expecting them to bare 
their soul to you right off the bat. Sometimes it may seem that your partner is not considering 
your feelings, but you can help them see your side by rationally presenting facts and logical 
explanations for your side of the argument.
