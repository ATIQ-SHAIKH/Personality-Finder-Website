    ISTP: The Crafter (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving) 

    ISTP (introverted, sensing, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality 
    types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). People with ISTP personalities 
    enjoy having time to think alone and are fiercely independent. ISTPs also love action, new 
    experiences, hands-on activities, and the freedom to work at their own pace. 
    ISTPs enjoy taking things apart just to see how they work. They are logical and rational, 
    but are more interested in practical applications than in abstract ideas. They love doing new 
    things and can become bored with routines rather quickly. 

    Key ISTP Characteristics

    People with an ISTP personality are results-oriented. When there is a problem, they want to quickly
     understand the underlying cause and implement some type of solution.
    ISTPs enjoy new experiences and may often engage in thrill-seeking or even risk-taking behaviors. 
    They often engage in risky or fast-paced hobbies such as motorcycling, hang gliding, bungee jumping, 
    surfing, or ice hockey. In some cases, they may seek out adventure by choosing careers in areas such as racing, 
    flying, or firefighting. They prefer to make judgments based upon objective criteria rather than personal beliefs or values.
    ISTPs are often described as quiet, but with an easygoing attitude towards others.
    ISTPs are not well attuned to the emotional states of others, and they can sometimes be seen as a bit insensitive. 
    They also distance themselves from their own emotions, ignoring their feelings until they become overwhelming.
    One common misconception about ISTPs is that they are the stoic, silent type. While they do tend to be reserved, this
     does not mean that they do not experience strong emotions. Instead, they are good at keeping a cool head, maintaining 
     their objectivity, and coping with crisis.

    Cognitive Functions

    The MBTI suggests that people possess a number of different cognitive functions (thinking, sensing, feeling, and intuition)
     that can then be directed inwards (introverted) or outwards (extraverted). The hierarchical arrangement of these functions
      is what makes up each individual's personality, the MBTI suggests.
    
    The dominant function is the most prominent aspect of personality, although the auxiliary function also plays an important 
    supporting role. The tertiary and inferior functions are less important and may operate on a largely unconscious basis or may 
    become more apparent during times when a person is under stress.1
    Dominant: Introverted Thinking
    
        ISTPs spend a great deal of time thinking and dealing with information in their own heads. This means they do not spend a great
         deal of time expressing themselves verbally, so they are often known as being quiet.
        It may seem like the ISTPs approach to decision-making is very haphazard, yet their actions are actually based upon careful observation and thought.
        They deal with the world rationally and logically, so they are often focused on things that seem practical and useful.
        Because they are so logical, ISTPs are good at looking at situations in an objective way and avoiding subjective or emotional 
        factors when making decisions. People with this personality type can be difficult to get to know, often because they are focused 
        so much on action and results rather than on emotions.
    
    Auxiliary: Extraverted Sensing
    
        ISTPs prefer to focus on the present and take on things one day at a time. They often avoid making long-term commitments and would 
        rather focus on the "here and now" rather than think about future plans and possibilities.
        ISTPs tend to be very logical and enjoy learning and understanding how things operate. They might take apart a mechanical device just to see how it works.
        While they are good at understanding abstract and theoretical information, they are not particularly interested in such things unless 
        they can see some type of practical application.
    
    Tertiary: Introverted Intuition
    
        This function often operates largely unconsciously in the ISTP personality. While they are not usually interested in abstract ideas, 
        they may take such concepts and try to turn them into action or practical solutions.
        It is this function that is behind the "gut feelings" that ISTP sometimes experience when making a decision. By synthesizing information 
        brought in by the dominant and auxiliary functions, this aspect of personality may be responsible for sudden "aha" moments of insight.
    
    Inferior: Extraverted Feeling
    
        This aspect of personality tends to operate in the background of the ISTP personality, but it can become more apparent during times of stress.
        During highly charged situations, ISTPs can sometimes lash out in sudden outbursts of emotion. They often ignore their own feelings until 
        things reach a boiling over point, which can lead to displaying emotions in ways that can seem inappropriate.

        Tips for Interacting With ISTJs
        Friendships
        
        ISTJs tend to get along best with friends who are similar to themselves. While they tend to be a bit serious and by the book, they do 
        like to have fun. They might not be willing to jump into new things, but you can be a great friend by helping them pursue hobbies and 
        activities that they enjoy.
        Parenting
        
        ISTJ parents tend to be quite focused on tradition and are good at providing security and stability to their children. Children of ISTJ 
        parents often find that their parents will treat them with care and respect and that they also expect the same treatment in return.
        
        Parents of ISTJ children will find that providing consistency can help their children feel more secure. Sticking to routines, introducing 
        change slowly, and giving them time to adjust to new situations are all ways to help an ISTJ child.
        Relationships
        
        While ISTJs may experience deep feelings, they often struggle to show that side of themselves in romantic relationships. You can be an 
        understanding partner by not expecting them to bare their soul to you right off the bat. Sometimes it may seem that your partner is not 
        considering your feelings, but you can help them see your side by rationally presenting facts and logical explanations for your side of the argument.
