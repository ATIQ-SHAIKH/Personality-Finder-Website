    ISTP: The Crafter (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving) 

    ISTP (introverted, sensing, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality 
    types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). People with ISTP personalities 
    enjoy having time to think alone and are fiercely independent. ISTPs also love action, new 
    experiences, hands-on activities, and the freedom to work at their own pace.
