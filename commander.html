    The acronym ENTJ represents one of the 16 personality types that are identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. This popular personality assessment was developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs. The assessment tool is based on Carl Jung's theory of personality types. Other people often describe people with this type of personality as assertive, confident, and outspoken.

According to psychologist David Keirsey, the ENTJ type is quite rare, accounting for a mere 2% of the population.1

Key ENTJ Characteristics
People with this personality type enjoy spending time with other people. They have strong verbal skills and interacting with others helps them feel energized.
ENTJ types prefer to think about the future rather than focus on the here-and-now. They usually find abstract and theoretical information more interesting than concrete details.
When making decisions, ENTJs place a greater emphasis on objective and logical information. Personal feelings and the emotions of others tend not to factor much into their choices.
ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.
They are highly rational, good at spotting problems, and excel at taking charge. These tendencies make them natural leaders who are focused on efficiently solving problems.
ENTJs are not necessarily good with emotions, but that does not mean they are intentionally cruel. They are prone to hiding their own emotions and sentimentality, viewing it as a weakness that should not be made known to others.

Cognitive Functions
Based upon the Jungian personality theory, the MBTI suggests that personality is composed of several different cognitive functions.2 These functions can be focused primarily outward (extraverted) or inward (introverted).


Each function relates to how people perceive the world and make decisions. The dominant function is the most prominent aspect of personality, while the auxiliary function plays a supporting role. The tertiary function has a weaker influence but can become more apparent when a person is under stress. The inferior function is primarily unconscious and is often a point of weakness. Developing this aspect can help people form a more balanced personality.


Dominant: Extraverted Thinking
This is an ENTJ preferred function and is expressed through the way they make decisions and judgments.
ENTJs tend to speak first without listening, making snap judgments before really taking in all the information about a situation.
While they tend to make snap judgments, they are also very rational and objective. They are focused on imposing order and standards on the world around them. Setting measurable goals is important.
Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition
People with this personality type are future-focused and always consider the possibilities when approaching a decision.
ENTJs are forward-thinking and are not afraid of change. They trust their instincts, although they tend to regret jumping to conclusions so quickly.
Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing
This cognitive function gives ENTJs an appetite for adventure. They enjoy novel experiences and may sometimes engage in thrill-seeking behaviors.
Because of their outward sensory focus, they also have an appreciation for beautiful things in life. They often enjoy surrounding themselves with things that they find attractive or interesting.
Inferior: Introverted Feeling
Introverted feeling is centered on internal feelings and values. Emotions can be difficult area for ENTJs, and they often lack an understanding of how this part of their personality contributes to their decision-making process.
When this aspect of personality is weak, ENTJs may find themselves feeling uncomfortable or awkward in settings where some type of emotional response is called for.
