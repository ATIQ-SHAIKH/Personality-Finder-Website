        ESFJ, also known as "The Caregiver" or "The Consul," is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. People with an ESFJ personality type tend to be outgoing, loyal, organized, and tender-hearted. ESFJs gain energy from interacting with other people.


        They are typically described as outgoing and gregarious. They have a way of encouraging other people to be their best and often have a hard time believing anything bad about the people they are close to.
        
        ESFJ Personality Type
        Verywell / JR Bee
        
        According to psychologist David Keirsey, approximately 9% to 13% of the population has an ESFJ personality type.1﻿
        
        Key ESFJ Characteristics
        People with an ESFJ or Consul personality tend to:
        
        Enjoy helping others
        Need approval
        Expect their kind and giving ways to be noticed and appreciated by others
        Be sensitive to the needs and feelings of others
        Be good at responding and providing the care that people need
        Want to be liked by others
        Get easily hurt by unkindness or indifference
        Derive their value system from external sources, including the community at large, rather than from intrinsic, ethical, and moral guidelines
        ESFJs raised with high values and standards tend to grow up to be generous adults. Conversely, those raised in a less enriched environment may have skewed ethics as adults and are more likely to be manipulative and self-centered.
        
        
        ESFJs also have a strong desire to exert control over their environment. Organizing, planning, and scheduling help people with this personality type feel in command of the world around them.
        
        
        ESFJs are naturally geared toward understanding other people. They are careful observers of others and are adept at supporting and bringing out the best in people. Because they are so good at helping others feel good about themselves, people feel drawn to ESFJs.
        
        Although ESFJs are people pleasers, they are not pushovers.

        Cognitive Functions
        The MBTI suggests several cognitive functions (thinking, sensing, feeling, and intuition) that help shape each individual’s personality. The hierarchical ordering of these functions is what contributes to the makeup of each personality type. Each function is expressed either inwardly (introverted) or outwardly (extroverted).
        
        
        Dominant: Extroverted Feeling
        ESFJs tend to make decisions based on their emotions and concern for others. As a result, they tend to think more about the personal impact of a decision rather than considering objective criteria.
        
        
        ESFJs tend to judge people and situations based upon their "gut feelings." They often make snap decisions as a result and are quick to share their feelings and opinions.
        
        This tendency can be great in some ways, as it allows them to make choices rather quickly. However, on the negative side, it can sometimes lead to overly harsh judgments of others.
        
        Auxiliary: Introverted Sensing
        ESFJs are more focused on the present than on the future. They are interested in concrete, immediate details rather than abstract or theoretical information.
        
        Tertiary: Extroverted Intuition
        This cognitive function helps ESFJs make connections and find creative solutions to problems. ESFJs are known to explore the possibilities when looking at a situation. They can often find patterns that allow them to gain insights into people and experiences.
        
        Inferior: Introverted Thinking
        ESFJs are organized and like to plan things out in advance. Planning helps people with this personality type feel more in control of the world around them.
        
        This aspect of personality helps the ESFJ analyze complex information, but it is often a point of weakness, especially when making sense of abstract or theoretical concepts.
