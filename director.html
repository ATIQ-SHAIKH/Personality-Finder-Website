        ESTJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). ESTJs are often described as logical, take-charge kind of people.1

 They are assertive and are very concerned with making sure that things run smoothly and according to the rules. They are committed to tradition, standards, and laws. They have strong beliefs and possess sensible judgment, and expect that other people uphold these same principles as well.


ESTJ Personality Type
Verywell / JR Bee

An estimated 8% to 12% of the U.S. population has an ESTJ personality.2﻿ David Keirsey, the creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, suggests that the ESTJ personality type is the "Guardian Supervisor," one of four "Guardian" archetypes (Supervisor, Inspector, Provider, Protector).3﻿

Key ESTJ Characteristics
Individuals with this personality type tend to place a high value on tradition, rules, and security. Maintaining the status quo is important to ESTJs, and they often become involved in civic duties, government branches, and community organizations.
Because of their orthodox approach to life, they can sometimes be seen as rigid, stubborn, and unyielding. Their take-charge attitude makes it easy for ESTJs to assume leadership positions.
Their self-confidence and strong convictions help them excel at putting plans into action, but they can at times appear critical and overly aggressive, particularly when other people fail to live up to their high standards.
People often describe ESTJs as predictable, stable, committed, and practical. They tend to be very frank and honest when it comes to sharing their opinions, which can sometimes be seen as harsh or overly critical.

Cognitive Functions
The MBTI suggests that each personality type is made up of a number of cognitive functions (sensing, thinking, feeling, and intuition) that are either directed toward the outside world (extraverted) or inward (introverted).1﻿ The dominant function is the one that plays a primary role in personality, although the auxiliary function plays an important supporting role. The tertiary and inferior functions are less prominent, but can still have an influence on how people behave and interact with the world.


Dominant: Extraverted Thinking
ESTJs rely on objective information and logic to make decisions rather than personal feelings.4﻿ They are skilled at making objective, impersonal, and impartial decisions. Rather than focusing on their own subjective feelings when they are making judgments, they consider facts and logic in order to make rational choices.
People with ESTJ personality types tend to be very practical. They enjoy learning about things that they can see an immediate, real-world use for, but tend to lose interest in things that are abstract or theoretical. ESTJs enjoy concrete facts as opposed to abstract information.4﻿
They are good at making fast and decisive choices, but they may often rush to judgment before considering all the information about a situation. One positive side, this trait makes them good leaders, but it can sometimes lead them to being viewed as harsh or abrasive.

Auxiliary: Introverted Sensing
They are good at remembering things with a great deal of detail. Their memories of past events can be quite vivid, and they often utilize their recollections of past experiences to make connections with present events.
Because their sensing function is focused inwardly, they tend to be less concerned with novelty and more focused on familiarity. They enjoy having habits and routines that they can depend upon. While this gives them stability and predictability, it can also make them stubborn and unyielding at times.

Tertiary: Extraverted Intuition
This aspect of personality seeks out novel ideas and possibilities. It compels people with this personality type to explore their creativity.
As they process new ideas and information, they may explore the possible meanings in order to spot new connections or patterns. This allows them to look at incoming information and recognize that there may be more than one interpretation or possible outcome.

Inferior: Introverted Feeling
When this function is used, it may lead ESTJs to make decisions based more on feelings than on logic. These are often internal valuations that lead to "gut feelings" about some situations. While this function is not used as often, in some cases a person might allow their subjective feelings to override their objective interpretation of a situation.
ESTJs tend to give much thought to their own emotions, so this function often operates on a largely unconscious basis.
