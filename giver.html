    ENFJ, also known as the giver or protagonist personality, is one of the 16 different personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.1﻿﻿﻿ Some other types are known by the acronyms ESFJ, ENFP, INFP, ISFJ, and INTP.


People with ENFJ personality type are often described as warm, outgoing, loyal, and sensitive.

ENFJ Personality Type
Verywell / JR Bee

Of all the personality types, the ENFJ is often perceived as being the strongest "people person." They are capable of forging friendships with all personality types, even with more introverted or reticent individuals.

Because of their ability to sense what others feel and affect how people behave, they do have the ability to influence and even manipulate others. This is balanced by their strong value system and desire to help other people be the best that they can be. ENFJ is the opposite of the ISTP personality type.

Psychologist David Keirsey suggests that approximately 2% to 5% of all people have an ENFJ personality.

Key ENFJ Characteristics
ENFJs are strong extraverts and enjoy spending time with other people.
ENFJs have great people skills and are often described as warm, affectionate, and supportive.
ENFJs are great at encouraging other people and derive personal satisfaction from helping others.
ENFJs are often so interested in devoting their time to others that they can neglect their own needs.
ENFJs also have a tendency to be too hard on themselves, blaming themselves for when things go wrong and not giving themselves enough credit when things go right. Because of this, it is important that people with this personality type regularly set aside some time to attend to their own needs.
ENFJs are good at bringing consensus among diverse people. For this reason, they can be outstanding leaders and bring enthusiasm to a group that can be motivating and inspirational.
One common myth about the protagonist personality is that they are always sociable. While they love people, they do need time alone in order to assimilate and organize their thoughts.

Cognitive Functions
Each Myers-Briggs personality type can be identified by a hierarchical stack of cognitive functions that represent how each person interacts with the world. These functions focus on how people take in information about the world and how they then use this information to make decisions.


Dominant: Extraverted Feeling
ENFJs express this cognitive function through their engaging social behavior and harmonious social relationships. They are in tune with other people's feelings, often to the point that they ignore their own needs in order to please others.


People with a protagonist personality place a stronger emphasis on personal, subjective considerations rather than objective criteria when making decisions. How a decision will impact others is often a primary concern.


Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition
ENFJs like to think about the future rather than the present. They may often become so focused on the larger goal that they lose sight of the immediate details.

As ENFJs take in information about the world, their introverted intuition processes this data in order to create impressions, ideas, and thoughts. This allows them to spot patterns and make sense of complex or abstract data.

Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing
Extraverted sensing causes ENFJs to take in the present moment, gathering concrete details and sensory information from the environment. Because of this, they will often seek out novel or interesting experiences and sensations.

People with the protagonist personality type tend to be very aware of their present environment. This can lead to a great appreciation of aesthetics and a desire to create a pleasing space.

Inferior: Introverted Thinking
ENFJs are organized and enjoy structure and careful planning. Sticking to a predictable schedule helps ENFJs feel in control of the world around them.

Because this is an inferior function, ENFPs may not have a great deal of confidence in their own ability to be logical and organized.

Developing this function can help people with this personality type feel more balanced and in control of their decision-making process. Neglecting this aspect of personality can lead to relying solely on personal values when making decisions.
