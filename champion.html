    The ENFP personality type is one of the 16 different types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This acronym stands for Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Perceiving.

People with this type of personality are often described as enthusiastic, charismatic, and creative. People with this personality type are very charming, energetic, and independent. They are creative and do best in situations where they have the freedom to be creative and innovative.1 An estimated 5% to 7% percent of people are ENFPs.2

Key ENFP Characteristics
ENFPs have excellent people skills. In addition to having an abundance of enthusiasm, they also genuinely care about others. ENFPs are good at understanding what other people are feeling. Given their zeal, charisma, and creativity, they can also make great leaders.
People with this personality type strongly dislike routine and prefer to focus on the future.3 While they are great at generating new ideas, they sometimes put off important tasks until the last minute. Dreaming up ideas but not seeing them through to completion is a common problem.
ENFPs can also become easily distracted, particularly when they are working on something that seems boring or uninspiring.
ENFPs are flexible and like to keep their options open. They can be spontaneous and are highly adaptable to change. They also dislike routine and may have problems with disorganization and procrastination.

Cognitive Functions
Each personality type is composed of four cognitive functions that relate to how people process information and make decisions. It is the first two functions that play the most obvious role in personality. The latter two functions also play a role in personality, although their influence may only arise in certain settings or situations.


Dominant: Extraverted Intuition
ENFPs generally focus on the world of possibilities. They are good at abstract thinking and prefer not to concentrate on tiny details.4 They are inventive and focused on the future. ENFPs are good at seeing things as they might be rather than focusing simply on what they are. They have a natural tendency to focus on relationships and are skilled at finding patterns and connections between people, situations, and ideas.


Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling
When making decisions, ENFPs place a greater value on feelings and values rather than on logic and objective criteria. They tend to follow their heart, empathize with others, and let their emotions guide their decisions. ENFPs have a strong desire to be true to themselves and their values. In an ideal world, their world would be in congruence with their values.


Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking
This cognitive function is centered on logically organizing information and ideas. When looking at information, the ENFP may use this function to sort through disparate data to efficiently spot connections. For example, an ENFP might "think out loud" as they are working through a problem, laying out all the information to create an easily followed train of thought.

Inferior: Introverted Sensing
ENFPs express this function by comparing the things they are experiencing at the moment to past experiences. In doing so, they are often able to call to mind memories, feelings, and senses that they associate with those events. This allows the individual to seek patterns and form expectations for future events based upon their previous experiences.
